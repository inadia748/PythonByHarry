# Creating a tuple using parenthesis ()
t = (1, 2, 4, 5)

#Printing the elements of a tuple
print(t)

#Accessing the value of the tuple
print(t[0])
print(t[1])
print(t[2])
print(t[3])



# Cannot update the values of a tuple

#t[0] = 1000 # it will give error, because in a tuple, you cannot update the values of a tuple. In a 'list', you can update the values.

#print(t) #tuple will not support item assignment


#t1 = (), empty tuple

#t1 = (1), Wrong way to declare a tuple with single element.

#t1 = (1, ). Tuple with Single element
